Hello!

welcome to my second project which consist of follow up work for my LinkedIn jobs web scraping project.

In this project, I will use the results from my LinkedIn job postings web scraper project which you can find in this 
repository https://github.com/ayanwu98/LinkedIn-Jobs-Web-Scraper-Project and perform data cleaning with Pandas and 
after the data has been cleaned up, I will perform some data explotarion to extract interesting information regarding the 
Data Science job market.
